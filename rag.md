# RAG Implementation Checklist

Based on the discussion in @jan13class.md and your plan to use LangSmith, OpenAI, and Pinecone, here is a comprehensive checklist to guide your MVP development:

---

## 1. Environment Preparation
1. Make sure you have the following packages and tools installed:
   - Node.js / npm (or yarn)
   - An up-to-date version of Python (if you plan to run scripts or notebooks for embedding)
   - Pinecone SDK
   - OpenAI libraries
   - LangSmith library (or any other LLM orchestration tool you plan to use)

2. Create and update necessary `.env` files (but never commit them):
   - Store Pinecone API key, OpenAI API key, and any other secrets in environment variables.
   - Use `.gitignore` to ensure these secrets are not pushed to the repository.

3. Confirm your credentials are valid:
   - Pinecone index created and keys accessible.
   - OpenAI keys tested with a sample prompt.

---

## 2. Data Ingestion & Preprocessing
1. Retrieve chat messages (e.g., from your Postgres DB or wherever they are stored).
2. Decide on chunking strategy:
   - Either split by individual message (if short) or by a custom chunk size (for longer messages).
   - Keep track of original metadata (like message ID, channel ID for context).

3. Clean or normalize the text if needed:
   - Remove unnecessary HTML, markdown artifacts, or user mentions that are not crucial to context.

---

## 3. Embedding the Data
1. Use OpenAI or another embedding service:
   - Ensure the embedding model you select is consistent (e.g., “text-embedding-3-large”).
2. Generate embeddings for each chunk (or message).
3. Integrate with LangSmith (optional step to orchestrate requests and keep logs/observations).
4. Store any relevant metadata alongside the embeddings, such as:
   - Message ID or reference
   - Timestamp
   - Channel or workspace identifiers

---

## 4. Vector Database Setup (Pinecone)
1. Create a Pinecone index with appropriate dimension matching your embedding model.
2. Configure index settings (e.g., metric type like cosine or dot-product).
3. Insert your embeddings into the Pinecone index:
   - Include metadata so you can filter or track relevant fields.

---

## 5. Retrieval Testing
1. Write a small script or notebook:
   - Embed a sample query using OpenAI or your chosen model.
   - Perform a similarity search on Pinecone with that query.
2. Inspect the top-K results:
   - Verify that the retrieved chunks match the user’s query contextually.

3. If results are poor:
   - Tweak chunk sizes, re-check embedding model choice, or consider advanced prompting (e.g., rewriting queries with LangSmith).

---

## 6. LLM Integration
1. Once retrieval is working, feed the retrieved chunks into your LLM prompt:
   - Use OpenAI (e.g., GPT-3.5 or GPT-4) or another LLM.
   - Provide context in the system or user prompt in combination with the user’s query.
2. Check the LLM output:
   - Confirm it references the retrieved context properly.
   - Evaluate answers for correctness, completeness, and coherence.

3. Log your interactions:
   - Use LangSmith for orchestrating the chain of retrieval + generation.
   - Keep track of any issues that arise (like rate limits or timeouts).

---

## 7. Slack Integration
1. Create or update a Slack slash command (e.g., `/askAI`):
   - This command should accept a user’s question as input.
2. Build or adapt your endpoint to:
   1. Receive the user question.
   2. Embed and query Pinecone for relevant chunks.
   3. Call the LLM with the retrieved context.
   4. Return the final assistant answer back to Slack.

3. Test in a private channel or workspace to confirm correct workflow and responses.

---

## 8. Summaries & Additional Features
1. Add a “summarize messages” feature:
   - Let the user ask for a summary of an entire channel or timeframe.
   - Use the same retrieval approach to grab relevant messages, then feed them into the LLM with a “summarize” prompt.
2. Consider advanced filtering or re-ranking:
   - If you have multiple channels, filter metadata by channel ID.
   - Experiment with re-ranking or combining multiple top-K results to refine your final answer.

---

## 9. Security & Key Management
1. Double-check that all credentials (OpenAI keys, Pinecone API keys, etc.) are securely stored:
   - Use environment variables.
   - Keep `.env` files out of version control through `.gitignore`.
2. Validate each commit to avoid leaking secrets.

---

## 10. Productionizing
1. Monitor usage and LLM tokens spent (cost management).
2. Add error handling and logs around LLM calls and Pinecone queries.
3. Ensure your pipeline is efficient — consider caching repeated queries or storing intermediate results if needed.

## Next Steps
- With a working RAG pipeline, attend your scheduled workshops (e.g., AWS workshop) and continue refining your approach based on best practices around prompt engineering, embedding strategies, data security, and performance.
