**Meeting Summary**  
1. **Purpose & Context**  
   - The team discussed implementing **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** to enhance their Slack-based chat application with AI features.  
   - RAG involves embedding chunks of text (e.g., user messages) in a vector database, retrieving relevant pieces based on user queries, and then passing those retrieved snippets into an LLM for more accurate and context-aware responses.  
   - They emphasized the need to handle API keys and AWS credentials securely, as multiple breaches occurred where keys were inadvertently pushed to public repos.

2. **Key Technical Points**  
   - **Vector Database Setup**  
     - Pinecone (or another vector DB) stores embeddings (e.g., from OpenAI) for quick similarity search.  
     - Be consistent with the embedding model’s dimension size across all steps.
   - **Chunking / Splitting Documents**  
     - Decide how to split the text (messages) into chunks—either per message or using a more sophisticated approach if messages are long.  
     - Store these chunks as documents in the vector database.  
   - **Query & Retrieval**  
     - When a user asks a question, the system embeds the query, finds top-K similar chunks, and includes those chunks as context in the LLM prompt.  
   - **RAG Fusion**  
     - Optionally, queries can be “rewritten” in multiple variations to improve retrieval (especially if user language doesn’t match how documents are written).  
     - Combine results from multiple searches and re-rank them to produce more accurate context.  
   - **Security & Keys**  
     - Do **not** commit `.env` files or keys to GitHub.  
     - Use `.gitignore` and environment variables.  
     - Validate what files you add to Git to ensure no secrets are exposed.  
   - **MVP Guidance**  
     - Start with a minimal working pipeline:  
       1. Dump chat messages from your existing DB and embed them.  
       2. Store embeddings in the vector database.  
       3. Query the vector DB and verify relevant chunks are retrieved.  
       4. Integrate the LLM to generate final answers using the retrieved context.  
       5. Connect this pipeline to a new API route in your Slack app (e.g., a `/askSlack` command).

## Actionable Next Steps

1. **Design Your MVP Flow**  
   - Determine a simple user journey. For example, a `/askAI` Slack command that triggers your RAG pipeline.  
   - Clarify how you’ll store the user messages (e.g., in a Postgres or Mongo DB) so you can embed them later.

2. **Implement Basic RAG Functionality**  
   - **Embed Existing Messages**  
     - Export or query your chat messages from the DB, generate embeddings with OpenAI, and store them in Pinecone (or another vector DB).  
   - **Test Retrieval**  
     - Write a small script/notebook to query Pinecone and print out retrieved messages to confirm you’re getting relevant chunks back.  
   - **Integrate an LLM**  
     - Once retrieval looks good, feed the retrieved messages (as context) plus the user’s question into an LLM prompt.  
     - Verify the LLM uses that context to answer accurately.

3. **Connect to Slack**  
   - Create or modify an **API endpoint** in your Slack app that:  
     1. Takes in the user’s question.  
     2. Retrieves relevant vectors from Pinecone.  
     3. Calls the LLM for a final answer.  
     4. Sends the response back to Slack.

4. **Secure All API Keys**  
   - Remove any `.env` files or secrets from version control.  
   - Use `.gitignore` properly.  
   - Validate every Git commit to ensure no credentials are leaked.

5. **Prepare for Upcoming Workshops**  
   - Have a **working end-to-end RAG pipeline** by Wednesday so you can optimize prompt engineering and embeddings at that time.  
   - Attend the **mandatory AWS workshop** on Thursday to finalize best practices for key management, credentials, and deploying your service.
